># 100 Days of Go Challenge ðŸš€

## About the Challenge
Iâ€™m learning Go using the [official Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc) and following the [Go Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/golang). Each day, Iâ€™ll dive into new concepts, practice coding, and share my learnings.

## Go Developer Roadmap
The [Go Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/golang) outlines essential topics like Go basics, concurrency, web development, testing, and dependency management to help developers master Go efficiently.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to Go
- Installing Go and Setting Up
- Go CLI Basics
- Variables and Data Types in Go
- Loops and Conditions
- Functions in Go
- Arrays and Slices
- Structs and Methods
- Maps in Go
- Goroutines and Concurrency
- Error Handling in Go
- Testing in Go

## How to Follow
I will update this repository daily with my progress and projects. You can also follow my journey on [Medium](https://medium.com/@blitzbugg), where Iâ€™ll share detailed write-ups on each topic.

Letâ€™s Go! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
